"""Which test modules one CI shard runs: `python tests/shard.py 2/3` prints unittest -k arguments for the second of three
shards (e.g. `-k tests.test_forecast. -k tests.test_notify.`).

The Postgres tests are split across runners, each with its own Postgres, because on one runner they mostly wait on each
other (one shared schema, the settings lock in tests/shared.py): four workers there ran only 1.8× faster than one.
Modules are spread greedily by file size, which tracks their running time closely, so a new or growing module finds its
own place without a table of timings to keep up to date. Every module lands in exactly one shard.
