"""Checking what someone typed or sent: numbers, amounts of money, whole numbers, short texts, days and on/off flags.

Each module that takes input keeps its own error class and wording, so a Validator is made with both; the checks
themselves are shared. A number is db.number's (which refuses nan, inf and anything past db.MAX_NUMBER), after dropping
only the characters asked for (a pasted "$1,234.50"), and isn't rounded. An amount of money (a transaction's, a bill's,
a budget's, a filter's) is a number of at most MAX_AMOUNT either way, rounded to the cent when that's asked for.

The API (runway/server/api/) checks everything a request sends with these before using it, so a value that can't be
read is a 400 saying which one, and anything else that goes wrong in a handler is a bug (a 500, reported).
