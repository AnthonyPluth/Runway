# The merge gate: one commit status ("Merge gate") on a pull request's head that says whether it's ready to merge, so a
# ruleset on main can require that one check instead of a list that goes stale. Run by .github/workflows/merge-gate.yml
# each time a pull request's workflows finish, from main's copy (it never runs a pull request's code).
#
# It passes when, on the pull request's head commit:
#   - the newest run of every workflow started by the pull request succeeded (or was skipped), and the ones in
#     REQUIRED_WORKFLOWS ran at all. CodeQL counts as one of them: GitHub's default setup runs it as a "dynamic" workflow
#     (not a pull_request one), under the name "PR #<n>";
#   - every other app's check run (CodeQL, Semgrep, Trivy, zizmor, ...) succeeded, and every commit status did, and the
#     ones in REQUIRED_STATUSES were set at all: "Agent review" (.github/workflows/agent-review.yml) is the independent
#     review, which fails on an agent's pull request with a blocking finding and passes on anyone else's.
# Anything still running makes it "pending". Workflows and apps that aren't about whether the change is sound are left
# out (IGNORED_*). When it passes on one of Dependabot's pull requests, it merges it (see the end).
#
# CodeQL's finishing starts no workflow here (GitHub sends no event for its own Actions runs), so when CodeQL is all
# it's waiting for, it looks again every POLL_SECONDS, up to POLL_ATTEMPTS times, rather than stay pending.
#
# Needs: GH_TOKEN, REPO (owner/name), and SHA (the head commit) or PR (a number). RUN_URL links the status to the run.
# DRY_RUN=1 prints what it would do instead of doing it.
