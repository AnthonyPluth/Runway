// What counts as a phone, decided once. Phones are for glancing and quick fixes (reading the numbers, recategorizing, marking
// a benefit used); heavier editing is for a computer, and those places show a note instead (DesktopOnly). The same query
// is the `phone:` and `desktop:` variants in app.css, so CSS and code always agree. A phone turned sideways still counts:
// it's wide, but short and touch-driven.
